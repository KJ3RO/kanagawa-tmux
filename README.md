# Kanagawa Themed Tmux!
Just look at [Omerxx's Instructions](https://github.com/omerxx/catppuccin-tmux) and replace all "catppuccin" with "kanagawa". I'm too lazy to right an entire docs.
(Btw, the background color was changed to my preference, just change it back to the original if you want. Its in kanagawa.tmuxtheme)
